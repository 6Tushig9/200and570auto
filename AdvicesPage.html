                Check your tyre pressures and increase them if necessary. 
                Overly low or high tyre pressures can change how your car drives and how 
                your tyres wear out, sometimes shortening their lifespan. Tyres must be 
                the right type and size for your model, with at least the minimum legal 
                tread depth of 1.6mm – trying the 20p test is a quick and simple way of 
                checking if your tread is above the legal limit.

                Ensure your oil level is between the minimum and maximum mark on your 
                car's dipstick. If you’re low on oil, you risk breaking down or causing 
                damage to your car’s engine. Too much oil can cause damage, too, so 
                don’t just pour a whole bottle in.

            <p>
                Aim to change your car’s battery every three years, if possible, as a 
                flat or faulty battery is a common cause of vehicle breakdowns.

                According to Green Flag, warning signs of battery failure include the 
                engine turning over more slowly than usual when you start it. Also, the 
                red battery light in the instrument display may flicker when you’re 
                driving or take longer than usual to go out after you’ve started the 
                engine.

            <p>
                Despite its name, coolant – a mixture of antifreeze and water – isn’t
                 just for winter. Your car needs it all year round to keep the engine 
                 at the right temperature. Check your car manual to make sure you stay
                  on top of your car’s coolant needs.

            <p>
                Test the handbrake and footbrake to ensure they work properly. 
                It’s a good idea to do this on your driveway or somewhere without 
                traffic, so you can give your brakes a go safely.

                Lots of people don’t know what the dashboard warning lights mean. 
                Take time to get to know what they’re about and how you should react 
                to each of them, so you’re not caught by surprise if one comes on 
                while you’re driving.
